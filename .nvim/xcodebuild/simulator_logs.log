This could be due to one of the following:
1. Injection does not work with Whole Module Optimization.
2. There are restrictions on characters allowed in paths.
3. File paths in the simulator are case sensitive.
4. The modified source file is not in the current project.
5. The source file is an XCTest that has not been run yet.
6. Xcode has removed the build logs. Edit a file and re-run.
Try a build clean then rebuild to make logs available or
